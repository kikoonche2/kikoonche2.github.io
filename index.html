			<p>Hi, I`m Enrique Checa. A spanish game designer with a software engineering background, who just finished a Game Design Master at U-Tad University in Madrid
				(Spain). <br/> 
				I discover the videogames industry and my love for making games three years ago, when I had the opportunity to attend the TrainJam (Game Jam in a train, Chicago - San Francisco) and
				the GDC. During the trip I discovered I wanted to dedicate my self to make games. Since then I had participated in many other Game Jams (repeating TrainJam), work in the development of two
				games at university and start a Game Design Master. <br/>
				I`m hardworking, eager to learn and a team player. Ready to start my career in the videogames industry</p>
