							<p>
								My name is Enrique. I'm a game designer with a software engineering background. I'm a junior developer with experience in game development development and AR/XR/VR technologies. <br />
								Over the last years I had participated in three videogames at university (two on degree and on master). The first one, was a small horror game made in Unity, I worked as programmer,
								implementing game mechanics and assembling the level. The second one, is a VR PVP Multiplayer game made in Unreal 4, I worked as programmer (mainly implementing game mechanics) and as producer.
								And the third one, during the Master, an Online Multiplayer BattleRoyale made in Uneral 4, that we continue developing. Worked as game designer, mainly designing and prototyping gameplay and UI. <br />
								I have experience working with multiple programming language, game engines, software design and tools like Git, Photoshop or VS. And the ability to create clean and fast code, knowledge of the game design 
								principles and the ability to communicate my design vision and accept feedback and changes about my work. I am hardworking, eager to learn and a team player.
